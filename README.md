This repository contains the following:

* __ZooEscapeMap.pdf__ - A layout of resultant visuals, and explanation / short report
* __Original_Data__ - Folder containing the original data I used, accessed Fall 2019
	* __Maine_Law_Enforcement_E911__ - Point shapefile from MEGIS of Maine police stations
	* __medotpubrds__ - Line shapefile from MEGIS of Maine public roads
* __Resultant_Data__ - Folder containing final resultant data
	* __roadsOSMFD_nd__ - Full network dataset of the study area roads, created with the OSM toolbox
	* __ZooEscapeRoutes__ - Line shapefile of roads you could reach from the zoo before the police could catch you
* __README.md__ - The file you're reading

The OSM dataset was not included because it's so big and there's really no reason to share the one I got. Esri geodatabase excluded for the same reason.
